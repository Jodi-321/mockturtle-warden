              Sockpuppet Sentinel is a secure-by-default chat MVP developed to support AI-assisted moderation and privacy-conscious communication.
            </p>

              This project emphasizes foundational security principles like JWT authentication, input sanitization, and IP-based access control. Designed as a weekend proof-of-concept, it lays the groundwork for future integrations with large language models and moderation frameworks.

            <p className="text-sm italic text-gray-500">
              Built with React, FastAPI, Docker, and deployed via AWS â€” this MVP keeps things clean, modern, and secure.
